üïäÔ∏è WhiteBird ‚Äî AI Narrative Network Report
Overview

WhiteBird is an experimental AI-driven research project that automatically maps and analyzes the public narratives for any topic.
This page presents a live, daily-updating report focused on a single topic:

AI Industry Narrative Analysis

Each report reveals how online discourse evolves ‚Äî who starts narratives, who amplifies them, and how they influence public perception. It uses data from major social platforms, news outlets, and influencer networks to expose the structure of influence behind trending topics.

What the Report Includes

üß† Narrative Map: A mind-map-style visualization connecting key figures, hashtags, organizations, and ideological clusters.

üìä Detailed Analysis: Examination of rivalries, alliances, echo chambers, and coordinated campaigns shaping the conversation.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Manipulation & Influence Detection: Identification of synchronized posting, bot amplification, and political or commercial steering of public opinion.

‚öñÔ∏è Sentiment & Power Metrics: Quantifies optimism, skepticism, and influence power among top actors.

üì∞ Executive Summary: Plain-language overview of current narrative balance, public sentiment, and emerging risks.

Purpose

WhiteBird exists to help researchers, journalists, policymakers, and everyday citizens understand how public perception is engineered.
By illuminating who shapes and spreads narratives, we aim to restore transparency, truth, and critical thinking in an increasingly AI-mediated information ecosystem.

This project serves as a prototype for a larger system ‚Äî the upcoming WhiteBird Narrative Intelligence Platform ‚Äî which will allow users to enter any topic and automatically generate a similar top-down narrative analysis report.

Why It Matters

Modern information warfare is fought not with weapons, but with words, algorithms, and attention.
Understanding who controls the story is the first step toward reclaiming independent thought and national resilience.
WhiteBird empowers Americans to see beyond manipulation ‚Äî to recognize patterns, players, and agendas shaping their worldview.

Funding & Vision

We maintain WhiteBird freely as a public gift to our fellow Americans ‚Äî a small act of digital patriotism in service of truth.
However, continued development and expansion require funding for infrastructure, data access, and research time.
Support will accelerate:

Development of the user-driven narrative search system

Advanced visualization dashboards

Real-time narrative manipulation detection

Expansion into new subject domains (health, politics, economics, defense)

If you believe in transparent AI and truth-based public discourse, please consider supporting or partnering with the project.
