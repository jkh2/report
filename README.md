# AI Narrative Network Report

This project automatically generates a **daily AI narrative analysis** using agentic tools.

The report includes:
- A **mind map-style graph** showing relationships between key players, hashtags, companies, and themes.
- A **detailed report** underneath analyzing echo chambers, rivalries, and influence campaigns.

It is designed to expose the shaping and steering of public narratives around AI.

🔄 This report updates daily via an automated task and is published here on GitHub Pages:
